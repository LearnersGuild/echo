2017-03-18T00:39:15.387Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,Anasauce,"@jamestewartjr  What if we make a job prep goal? The artifact would be a completed resume, and we can get together and do mock interview with questions from Hacking the Coding interview... and give each other reviews on the mock interview and our resumes.  "
2017-03-18T00:40:56.900Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,Anasauce,we could also set a spec to reach out via email to at least one contact from networking or apply for one job a day?
2017-03-18T06:06:43.842Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,Anasauce,"@jamestewartjr 1) us getting jobs is crucial to LG being successful so it seems like they should give us time to pursue that. 2) Learners Guild said they would have us technically ready to get a job by then end of this program. Part of that process is practicing whiteboarding, interviewing....being able to translate your technical skills to employers. 3) Bootcamps normally have their students do a final project and then they have companies that the schools work with come and watch them present their final projects...and they do other job hunting networking events worked into their program. Learners Guild said they wouldn't do any marketing or work with particular companies and that sort of makes sense to me...it's all for show and it hasn't been helping a lot of these people from bootcamps get jobs lately. ""Marketing"" only goes so far...some people are getting job interviews here that have no social media presence or go to popular networking events. Learners Guild has said that we can take whatever time off that we need to go to interviews and to practice interviewing so I don't see why we can't spend a week getting our job hunt and resumes together, figure out what companies we want to apply for and practicing interviewing. "
2017-03-18T06:34:00.450Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,Anasauce,"I see what you mean, though about making a goal ""to job hunt"" and then have a bunch of people that still have months left here wanting to do that goal now when it doesn't make sense. I don't know the answer, there are only so many hours in the day and job hunting takes time. A lot of people can't afford to live without the stipend so they have to find the time to job hunt at some point. People here have been taking the agency to practice whiteboarding here on the weekends and normally post about it in echo...I guess I'm wondering what other strategies you are looking for @jamestewartjr ?"
2017-03-20T16:10:53.048Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,Anasauce,yes @carlabagdonas that would be my tension...the time issue. I normally get around it by blocking out time when I am coaching and/or doing a solo goal to work on job hunting stuff...but I do feel somewhat out of integrity when I do so

Junior dev interviews are definitely *not* the same: some weigh more heavily on practical skills/coding ability, some ask questions about topics you'd learn in a data structures and/or algorithms course (e.g., ""How would you detect and remove a loop from a linked list?""), others rely on trivia about programming languages (e.g., ""How does 'virtual' work in C++?"", ""What are the differences between a class and an interface?"")(though this, thankfully, has become less common), some focus on object oriented design (""Design Monopoly""), some focus on systems design (e.g., ""Design Twitter""), etc."
2017-01-03T22:25:51.865Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,deonna,I also highly recommend doing this after you have a solid idea of how to implement the basic data structures and algorithms described in the core goals (#128 and #123).

2017-01-23T23:27:09.125Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,phoniks,"Hey @all, I wanted you to be the first to know, there's a recruiter from Vaco coming Wednesday at 1pm.  In this case, I think there is a real viable chance for this person to hire one or two of us, so I'd like for July Cohort to be the first people who he gets to know.  His name is Lavonte Kirven, and he's with Vaco - feel free to reach out on LinkedIn, and mention that you're excited to meet him. He's recently placed people with companies like Google and Hulu. The relationship between the Guild and recruiters can only be fruitful for us if it's also beneficial to them, so I ask that if you can make it Weds, even if it's just to say 'hi' briefly, that you do.  Even if he doesn't have the opportunity you're looking for now, showing him that we're enthusiastic about learning about the opportunities he represents is the best way to make sure he comes back when he is looking to fill your dream role. TL;DR: `Bruh might really have a job for you so you should come say hi. Weds @ 1`. (P.S. yall know how much I hate at_alls, but I just scheduled this, and its happening weds, and apparently coach queue has no regard for your personal time, so I just wanted to make sure busy people had the opportunity to plan.)"

If people want to socialize, hang out, chill in the kitchen, they should get here before 8:30am. Once the gong is rung, folks know it's time to get to work. This way, if people are socializing / hanging out in the kitchen after 8:30, there's more of a shared understanding and it's easier to remind people. Maybe there's a way we can create pity / catchy reminders that aren't nagging but are more motivational - reminders of why we're here...i don't know what that would be though, i'm bad at coming up with that stuff. something similar to the ""good job"" ladder - one person says it and people catch on, something small that everyone's hooked into."

2017-03-18T15:37:29.369Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,carlabagdonas,"hey @jamestewartjr and @Anasauce thanks for surfacing this conversation. i want to encourage you both to expand your thinking about what's possible within the current matrix / goal framework. there is an ""interviewing"" strand on the ""more"" tab of the matrix. maybe there needs to be a ""job search"" or ""job search prep"" strand right below it? maybe there's a multi-week goal that's needed, which is only reserved for people in their last 4 weeks? maybe learners in their last 4 weeks need to have the agency to work _off_ the matrix / outside of the weekly goal structure but there's a different structure they're working within - maybe with an accountability buddy (setting weekly goals around job search process, etc.) Maybe there need to be some level 3/4 goals that are _smaller_ in size so that you can do half and half. \n\nI'm not sure what the solution is, but I encourage you to hold the _tension_ tightly and the _solution_ lightly - meaning, make sure your tension is resolved, but be open to creative ways that might look. if I'm understanding you, it sounds like the tension is: ""job hunting and interviewing takes a lot of time, and i don't see how i'll have time for it within the current weekly goal structure"" - does that sound right?"
2017-03-20T17:22:00.185Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,carlabagdonas,thanks @Anasauce and @rachel-ftw - let me know if you need support getting this tension resolved - i think it's an important one!

Because of how our system is set up, you will still receive a notice at the 8-day mark letting you know that you've reached your limit and an email for anything beyond that letting you know that you've exceeded it.

2017-03-18T00:10:30.409Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,jamestewartjr,"I'm having a huge tension about the LG weekly process vs the iterative improvement process that's needed to get a job. I'm very hesitant to request a goal because it would create this impulsive action among ""the rest"" to see if they are ""job ready"" what ever that means. Many thousands of less skilled people have gotten jobs. Plus, getting jobs goals are different from learning stuff goals so those of us not in a level with mostly July cohort would have team tensions. There is an argument that interviewing for a job is not the goal of LG; therefore, should be kept outside of guild hours. I would argue to that statement with - learning to present oneself well (confidently answer difficult questions, present a cohesive-compelling story, and sharing your knowledge) are skills of career ""moving"" developers. None of the current weekly goals allow for such a process. Plus, what would be an artifact: updated resume, increasing LinkedIn views, job offer?  Ultimately my question is: what strategies and tactics (SATs) are you, learners, using to stay engaged with the game AND meeting your personal job search goals. If you want to share gray hat SATs with me because they are :eye: :eye: . You know how to contact me. Have a great weekend!"

2017-03-18T01:24:07.610Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,jamestewartjr,"As I said before, I don't believe a goal is a proper solution even if it is a solo goal. Maybe that's the best solution: whiteboard 25 questions, do 7 informational interviews etc... If it is, I feel bad that the only agency people have is to make goals related to the matrix. The goal library in its current form has created it's own problems: the specs are now immutable; therefore, guildies are less likely to debate trade-offs therefore less likely to have the ""I have strong opinions, but loosely held"" POV."
2017-03-18T01:38:55.971Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,jamestewartjr,"I really believe a goal is a bad fit.The goal library in its current form has a structure of do these things for a week, nothing else: specs are set, articles are preset, end result is much more structured then we created in our early days. Maybe I don't understand the job search process, but it has been a lot more dynamic, a lot more personal, and a lot less structured. I'm marketing myself, my skills, and my ability to be a fit for a company. LG has specifically said they will not be doing the marketing for us. The job search process is not compatible to the LG system. Thoughts @Anasauce ?"

You'll have an opportunity to ask the panelists questions.\n\nI encourage all Learners to RSVP as soon as possible! Spots are filling up fast: https://learnersguild.eventbrite.com\n\nSeveral hiring managers have already signed up and more will come if they see you all in attendance.

2017-01-21T00:32:32.568Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,needdra,"Hey friends - I have a little experiment I'd like to invite 2 or 3 of you into joining. We were planning to work with Launch Code to support learners in their job search. However, I've learned that Launch Code is somewhat limited in their scope because of where they're located. They're based in St. Louis and have offices in Miami, Rhode Island, and the Pacific Northwest. As a result they predominantly place applicants in companies located in those cities. They have limited relationships with companies in SF/Bay Area, New York and Chicago though they have placed some folks in companies there, but with much less frequency. \n\nThat being said, Launch Code does have resources that can be very useful to all of you at this point in your ramp up to interviews. Here's the process: You apply to their program, take their tech assessments (coding puzzles) and interview with them. Then you'll get feedback on where you can tighten up your skills and interviewing presentation. \n\nThe objective is for you to get another set of eyes on your work in addition to the support our SEPs are providing. So far, Nico, Monica and Ana are gonna participate. Got room for 2 or 3 more of you. Let me know if you're interested and I'll get you all set up. <3\n\n"

2017-03-10T00:23:18.836Z,RqonNEZKguTXvPoDs,needdra,"what up July lovelies. Do you have a job search accountability buddy yet? you know, someone who knows where you're applying and when your interviews are? someone who holds you accountable to prep work and who tells you when something is misspelled on your linkedin profile? someone who reminds you of how awesome you are when your superego is doing the most? if  you don't have at least one of these people in your corner, then hurry up and get one. \n\nif you've found an awesome recruiter, share the resource. recruiters get paid by the companies they place you at (just in case you didn't know) so they have a vested interest in getting you a job. you don't need to do the job search on your own. buddy up. talk to Stephanie. talk to your learning facilitator. talk to your favorite SEP. \n\nthat is all. love you all. <3"

She's here to help you get your resume and other job search collateral in order. also, if you don't have an accountability buddy for the job search yet, please get one ASAP. lean on each other for support and encouragement. if you're feeling overwhelmed even a little bit, please consider using a recruiting agency to help you with the job search - they are full time job searchers who get paid when you get placed so they have a vested interest in getting you a job. there are tons of tech recruiters in the Bay Area. if you find a recruiter you like, please share about the agency in the jobs channel. love you all. <3"
